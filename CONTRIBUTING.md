## Diagrams

We draw factory diagrams leveraging Google Slides.
You can find the diagrams file [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1I7-OQ60DD__MtfdUtw_bPkiRADN7NEmVKCl1OxfzTNA). The deck is private and you will need to request access.
When drawing new diagrams you can leverage the [official Google Cloud Icons deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fD1AwQo4E9Un6012zyPEb7NvUAGlzF6L-vo5DbUe4NQ).

## Useful Commands

Setup dev environment

```shell
python3 -m venv ~/.venv-genai-factory
source ~/.venv-genai-factory/bin/activate

pip install -r tests/requirements.txt
pip install -r tools/requirements.txt
```

Generate tfdoc (example for `cloud-run-single`)

```shell
./tools/tfdoc.py modules/cloud-run-single
```

Run tests

```shell
# Run all tests
pytest tests

# Run a test for one module only
pytest tests/cloud_run_single/0-projects
```

Generate inventory for a factory module (example with cloud-run-rag/0-projects)

```shell
python tools/plan_summary.py cloud-run-rag/0-projects \
  tests/cloud_run_rag/0_projects/simple.tfvars
```

## Add a new factory

- Start copying an existing factory. [cloud-run-single](cloud-run-single/README.md) is a typical choice. Modify it as needed.
- Create a corresponding test in the tests folder. 
  - Follow the example of other factories. For example, [this](tests/cloud_run_single/0_projects/tftest.yaml) is the test definition for 0-projects of the cloud-run-single factory.
  - Start creating an empty inventory with `values:` only. Then run the `tools/plan_summary.py` command (example above) and update the inventory file with the output returned.
- Update the list of factories in the [main README.md](README.md).
